# Little Taco Shop

Welcome to the Little Taco Shop project! This is a web application for a small taco shop where customers can browse and order delicious tacos. The frontend of the project is developed using HTML and CSS, while the backend is built using MongoDB and Flask.

## Features

-   **User Interface:** The frontend is designed using HTML and CSS to create an appealing and user-friendly interface. Customers can view different types of tacos, add them to their cart, and proceed to the checkout process.
    
-   **Menu:** The menu section displays a variety of tacos with their descriptions and prices. Customers can browse the menu, select their desired tacos, and add them to their cart.
    
-   **Cart Management:** Customers can manage their cart by adding or removing tacos as needed. The cart keeps track of the selected tacos and their quantities.
    
-   **Order Placement:** Once customers have selected their desired tacos, they can proceed to the checkout process. The backend built with MongoDB and Flask handles the order placement and updates the order status.
    
-   **Authentication:** The web application provides authentication functionality, allowing customers to create accounts, log in, and track their order history.
